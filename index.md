## Dan Capellupo | Data Scientist

I am a senior data scientist and manager at Deloitte.

Formally, I was a freelance data scientist, working with clients to develop unique data
science solutions that are tailored to each organizationâ€™s specific needs and
desired business outcomes. I combine statistical data processing and analytics
with the most current machine learning and AI techniques.

Past and current projects range from machine learning on aggregated news
article text to algorithms that automatically monitor IoT telemetry.
